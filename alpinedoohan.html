        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Alpine’s F1 reserve since 2023, Jack Doohan steps up to full-time racer for 2025, having been handed an early Grand Prix debut for the team at 2024’s season finale.
        </p>
        <p>
            Doohan is the latest Aussie to join the F1 grid, and the young Queenslander is not short of racing pedigree – he already has plenty of F3 and F2 wins to his name, and that’s before we mention his father, five-time motorcycle world champion, Mick.
        </p>
        <p>
            After his single-seater debut in British Formula 4, followed by stints in Italian F4, ADAC F4 and Asian F3, Doohan stepped up to FIA Formula 3 in 2020, finishing championship runner-up the following year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 2022 season saw him join Alpine’s driver development programme and finish sixth overall in his rookie FIA Formula 2 campaign. The following year he was up to third, thanks to three race wins, including impressive back-to-back feature race victories in Hungary and Belgium.
        </p>
        <p>
            Formula 1 experience came via Alpine, with free practice outings at Grands Prix in 2022, 2023 and 2024. And having served his apprenticeship with the French squad, Doohan’s reward is a shot at the big time as team mate to F1 race winner Pierre Gasly.
