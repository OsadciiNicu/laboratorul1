                <div class="bio-content">
                    <p>Lando Norris may not be named after Star Wars rebel Lando Calrissian - his Mum just liked the moniker - but he has flair and fighting spirit in bountiful supply.</p>
                    <p>McLaren had the British teenager on their books for two years before fast-tracking him into F1's galaxy of stars in 2019. A firecracker in his junior career, with a penchant for pole positions and wheel-to-wheel tussles, Norris didn't let them down.</p>
                    <p>Paired with the highly-rated - and far more experienced - Carlos Sainz, his rookie season was impressive, Norris edging the Spaniard in their head-to-head qualifying battle, scoring points 11 times, and only narrowly missing out on a top-10 championship placing.</p>
                    <p>A maiden podium came in 2020, with more following in the subsequent two seasons - he narrowly missed out on a win at Russia 2021 - as he dominated another more senior team mate, Daniel Ricciardo, to firmly establish himself in F1's top tier.</p>
                    <p>It was the 2024 season that finally brought Norris his breakthrough win - along with three more - as he became the biggest challenger to Max Verstappen's drivers' crown and led McLaren to their first constructors' title since 1998.</p>
                    <p>Away from the track, Norris brims with a modest charm and an artistic side sees him design and paint his own race gear as a hobby. The focus for the future is allying artistry and ambition on track as McLaren rely on the promise of youth to take them back to the top.</p>
                    <p>Norris hopes the downforce will be with him...</p>
