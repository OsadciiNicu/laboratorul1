        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Lando Norris may not be named after Star Wars rebel Lando Calrissian - his Mum just liked the moniker - but he has flair and fighting spirit in bountiful supply.
        </p>
        <p>
            McLaren had the British teenager on their books for two years before fast-tracking him into F1’s galaxy of stars in 2019. A firecracker in his junior career, with a penchant for pole positions and wheel-to-wheel tussles, Norris didn’t let them down.
        </p>
        <p>
            Paired with the highly-rated – and far more experienced – Carlos Sainz, his rookie season was impressive, Norris edging the Spaniard in their head-to-head qualifying battle, scoring points 11 times, and only narrowly missing out on a top-10 championship placing.
        </p>
        <p>
            A maiden podium came in 2020, with more following in the subsequent two seasons – he narrowly missed out on a win at Russia 2021 – as he dominated another more senior team mate, Daniel Ricciardo, to firmly establish himself in F1’s top tier.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was the 2024 season that finally brought Norris his breakthrough win – along with three more – as he became the biggest challenger to Max Verstappen’s drivers’ crown and led McLaren to their first constructors’ title since 1998.
        </p>
        <p>
            Away from the track, Norris brims with a modest charm and an artistic side sees him design and paint his own race gear as a hobby. The focus for the future is allying artistry and ambition on track as McLaren rely on the promise of youth to take them back to the top.
        </p>
        <p>
            Norris hopes the downforce will be with him…
